upon Abraham and Sarah to their great
comfort, so vouchsafe to send thy blessings

<h2>THE NEW HOME.</h2>


<p><span class = "firstletter">
<img src = "images/img_letter_t.png" width = "45" height = "45"
alt = "T"></img></span>he founding of a new home
marks an important era in a
human life. Whether you be
poor or wealthy, wise or ignorant, it is
all the same&mdash;you begin a new existence.
The associations of childhood and youth
now undergo a total change. The familiar
scenes disappear suddenly. Longfellow,
in his "Hanging of the Crane,"
writes the following touching words on
the eventful day:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <span class="i0">"O fortunate, O happy day,<br /></span>
    <span class="i0">When a new household finds its place<br /></span>
    <span class="i0">Among the myriad homes of earth,<br /></span>
    <span class="i0">Like a new star sprung to birth,<br /></span>
    <span class="i0">And rolled on its harmonious way<br /></span>
    <span class="i0">Into the boundless realms of space!"<br /></span>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <span class="i0"><b>. . . . .</b><br /></span>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
    <span class="i0">"For two alone, there in the hall,<br /></span>
    <span class="i0">Is spread the table round and small;<br /></span>
    <span class="i0">Upon the polished silver shine<br /></span>
    <span class="i0">The evening lamps; but, more divine,<br /></span>
    <span class="i0">The light of love shines over all;<br /></span>
    <span class="i0">Of love that says not mine and thine,<br /></span>
    <span class="i0">But ours, for ours is thine and mine."<br /></span>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <span class="i0"><b>. . . . .</b><br /></span>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <span class="i0">"They want no guests; they needs must be<br /></span>
    <span class="i0">Each other's own best company."<br /></span>
  </div>
</div>

<p>What sort of a home shall the new
one be? Shall it be the abode of
happy hearts and pure and noble lives,
or shall discontent and misery prevail?
Jane Welch Carlyle says truly: "If
ever one is to pray&mdash;if ever one is to
feel grave and anxious&mdash;if ever one is
to shrink from vain show and vain
babble&mdash;surely it is just on the occasion
of two human beings binding themselves
to one another, for better and
for worse, till death part them."</p>

<p>Great is the difference in households.
As one walks along a beautiful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
street in a city there is nothing in the
fronts of the houses to indicate the
kind of life which passes within doors.
But an intimate acquaintance, such as
a faithful pastor gains in the course of
his labors, often reveals the fact that in
some of the most magnificent houses
there is no peace or joy, while in some
of the humblest cottages there is a
calm and loving spirit which continues
and grows from year to year.</p>

<p>The kind of a house, even the adornments
which wealth and luxury bring,
do not determine the true home. The
two people who establish the new
household decide its quality.</p>

<p>That the people who occupy a
home decide its quality is beautifully
expressed by Nathaniel Cotton, a poet
of the last century:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"If solid happiness we prize,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within our breast this jewel lies;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And they are fools who roam:<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The world has nothing to bestow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From our own selves our joys must flow,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And that dear hut, our home."<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>If those who occupy the home resolve
to be happy and contented, to
avoid envying persons of larger means
and higher social position, to lead a
life of mutual confidence and esteem,
and to serve God with trustful love,
their home will be to them a sacred
place. I was once pastor of a church
in Fulton Street, Elizabeth, N. J., where
the most of the members were mechanics
and laborers and on the railroad.
Their circumstances were limited,
and they had but little power to
adorn their houses. But in some of
those homes there reigned such beauty
of spirit, such contentment with the
condition in life, such kindliness and
sympathy, such cheerfulness and patience,
that it was a joy to cross the
threshold and commune with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
members of the plain and unambitious
families. The memories of those visits
are among the most delightful of my
pastoral experience.</p>

<p>Suppose, then, your new home is
plain and homely. Remember, that
marble walls, and broad and polished
halls, and masterpieces in painting on
the walls, and a daily fare of luxuries,
and table service of silver and gold, and
a retinue of liveried servants do not
constitute a home. Though the new
home consist of only a few rooms, if mutual
love and admiration reign within
the narrow walls, no historical palace
can be half so beautiful or attractive.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Home's not merely four square walls,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Though hung with pictures nicely gilded;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Home is where affection calls,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Filled with shrines the heart hath builded.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><b>. . . . .</b><br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Home's not merely roof and room;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Home needs something to endear it;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Home is where the heart can bloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where there's some kind heart to cheer it."<br /></span>
</div>

<p class="lastpara">But for a home to be truly beautiful
there must needs be, always, one guest&mdash;the
Saviour. There were many
magnificent buildings in Jerusalem
when He walked its streets and performed
his miraculous works of healing.
But in all the land, and in all the
ages, there was never one more charming
than that little home in Bethany,
where Lazarus and his sisters Mary
and Martha constituted the household.
And why was that the perfect home?
Because our Lord was always the welcome
Guest.</p>

<h2>THE HOME ALTAR.</h2>


<p><span class = "firstletter">
<img src = "images/img_letter_e.png" width = "45" height = "45"
alt = "E"></img></span>very thing depends on
the way you begin your new life
in your own new home. The
household altar is a supreme necessity.
No hesitation or timidity should be allowed
to prevent family worship. If
both of you are members of the Church,
the holding of a brief family worship
need not be a serious trial. The difficulty
will be when only one is a Christian,
and still greater will it be if neither
is a Christian. What is to be done under
such circumstances? Must the having
family worship be postponed until the
religious life be commenced? That is
uncertain, and it may be years before
a household altar is established. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
only safe way is to begin at once by
holding a short service. Simple it may
be. It was the daily custom of President
Hayes, during his presidential
term of office, to convene his family
for daily worship. The prayer consisted
of only the Lord's Prayer. But
it was enough. The minds of the
household were directed toward spiritual
things. The help of God was
sought, to bear whatever burdens the
day might bring.</p>

<p>However great the embarrassment
in the face of this great duty, let it not
prevent the brief domestic worship.
Begin&mdash;begin immediately. A short
Scripture reading, followed by prayer,
even only the Lord's Prayer, will be
sufficient. There are good forms of
prayer, some of which I have used to
advantage. Fletcher's <i>Family Devotion</i>;
Sturm's <i>Family Devotions</i>; Morison's
<i>Family Prayers</i>; Cumming's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
<i>Daily Family Devotion</i>; <i>Family Worship</i>,
by one hundred and eighty clergymen
of the Church of Scotland;
Cassell's <i>Family Devotion</i>; Dale's <i>Domestic
Liturgy</i>; Thornton's <i>Family
Prayers</i>; Thompson and Spurgeon's
<i>Home Worship and the Use of the
Bible in the Home</i>; and Jay's <i>Morning
and Evening Exercises</i>, are good
books for this purpose. The works
of Fletcher, Thornton, and the <i>Home
Worship</i> of Thompson and Spurgeon
are worthy of special commendation.
Even when one is accustomed to
extemporaneous prayer, the use of
one of the above books will, nevertheless,
be of great service in preventing
stereotyped phrases and trains of
thought. I have often found that my
own needs, and I believe those of my
family, have been better and more exactly
described by others than by myself.
It is best, however, to get into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
no fixed form. Let the extemporaneous
prayer, or the printed form of
prayer, be used judiciously, as circumstances
require.</p>

<p>Care should be taken that the home
worship may not be made tedious, and
thus become a burden. I have always
found it best to use the Bible for the
Scripture selection rather than the selections
made in the books containing
forms of prayer. It is well to read the
Bible in course, and to have <i>the same
copy of the Bible</i> from which to read
brief selections, without being governed
by the divisions in chapters.
Your one and the same Bible, being
used every day in family worship, becomes
very precious with the growing
years. It will be associated with all
the tenderest memories of the home
life. I have occasionally used a different
copy of the Bible in my own
home for family worship, but none is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
half so dear as the plain, old, and
well-worn copy with which I began,
when I established my own home altar,
far back in the years.</p>

<p>But, besides worship together at the
family altar, there should be private
prayer. Every one should have a
place where he can worship God
alone. Our Lord saw the necessity
that each of his disciples should be
alone with him. Hence he said:
"When thou prayest, enter into thy
closet, and when thou hast shut thy
door, pray to thy Father which is in
secret; and thy Father which seeth in
secret shall reward thee openly." Begin
the day by solitary communing
with God. End the day in the same
way, by asking God for his forgiveness
for the past, for his preservation for
the night, and for his care in all the
time to come.</p>

<p>But some one may say: "Does not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
this attention to religious duties make
the new home gloomy?" Not at all.
It is the way to make it bright and
cheerful. The wedding day soon
passes by, and in time will come the
regular domestic life, with its monotony
and cares. Leave this life to
God's ordering. He alone can make
us strong for every hour's demands.
The German poet Schirmer says a
wise word, which well applies to all
who begin life in the new home:</p>

<p class="lastpara">Vinet here lays down the true principle
of a thoroughly good life at
home: "Wherever we advance in the
path of marriage and of life, with eyes
lifted up toward a Saviour we love,
with a salvation we hope for, with a
spirit of prayer and supplication
through which Jesus Christ constantly
intervenes by his Spirit between the
husband and wife&mdash;there, indeed, a
marriage may be happy; nay, must be
infallibly so. The union between two
converted hearts is necessarily sweet
and unutterable; without this there is
no security." The new home consecrated
by prayer&mdash;daily prayer&mdash;will
become what that beautiful home of
Sir Thomas More was&mdash;"a school and
exercise of the Christian religion."</p>



<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page_28" id="page_28">[28]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE HOME BEAUTIFUL.</h2>


<p><span class = "firstletter">
<img src = "images/img_letter_g.png" width = "45" height = "45"
alt = "G"></img></span>reat art is required in making
beautiful the new home.
The house need not be large
and stately in order to be attractive to
the eye. More attention has been paid
of late in this country to the adornment
of homes than in former years. We
Americans begin to see, as never before,
that the enjoyment of the occupants of
a house is in some way connected with
the furnishing and general effect. Let
every room be used. Let the inner
doors be kept wide open. In this way
the atmosphere will be uniform and of
free circulation; the interior of the
house will appear to its full size, and
the general effect will be more cheerful.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Even the humblest means need not
prevent some simple hangings and a
few prints on the walls.</p>

<p>I would let the sunlight pour into
the new home. The old dread that the
carpets will get faded and the curtains
get spoiled is an abomination. My
own habit is, so soon as I get down
stairs in the morning&mdash;and I am an
early riser&mdash;to draw aside the curtains,
to let the shades fly up, and to throw
the sashes wide open. By and by, if
from the street this airy appearance is
considered a little unfashionable, and
those within choose to shut out the
sunlight in a measure, I rejoice that I
have had my unfashionable way, and the
sun has had his golden way, for a while
at least. Gladness comes into the house
with the blaze of the blessed sun. Let
all the rooms share the joy. I suppose
a carpet somewhat faded will wear as
long as if the colors were fresh. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
if the penalty for having bright and
sunny rooms is to be some faded carpets
and window hangings, let the full
penalty be paid, and cheerfully, too.
No price is too great for a bright and
sunny home.</p>

<p>The sight of a few flowers adds to
the beauty of even the humblest home.
Even a sprig of arbutus or jessamine,
or a lily of the valley, on the table, will
make every meal the sweeter. The
Germans of the poorest class, all over
the Fatherland, never forget to have
flowers in their lowly homes. If the
family occupy only a few rooms in a
lofty story, they will be sure to have
beautiful plants on the window-ledge,
and here and there within the rooms.
These are of such kind that the succession
of flowers is well kept up in all
seasons. Throughout the year, when
there is no frost, these flowering plants
at the German windows can be seen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
from the street to the highest flat.
The varied flowers and the hanging
vines form beautiful pictures in village
and town.</p>

<p class="lastpara">Away with the thought that wealth
is needed to make the home beautiful!
It is a question of taste, tact, and a desire
to please another. On the very
street where I live there is a quiet little
house, occupied by a newly-married
couple. It is inexpensive, and the
furniture is not costly. But there is
so much taste in the furnishing and
ornamentation, and there is so much
brightness in all the rooms, that the
home is a charming picture. I seldom
pass it without thinking of the beautiful,
but not costly, interior.</p>

<h2>GOOD READING AT HOME.</h2>

<p><span class = "firstletter">
<img src = "images/img_letter_a.png" width = "45" height = "45"
alt = "A"></img></span>&nbsp;home without books is a
desert. In these days all the
standard authors can be bought
at small price, and even the humblest
home should be adorned with the companionship
of at least some of them.
You may not have a taste for reading;
at any rate, you may think you have not.
But possibly you have made a mistake
in the kind of books you have tried to
enjoy, and so imagined that you do not
like any books. Try another class, and
you will likely be surprised to find that
you can enjoy them. Suppose you
have not the experience to select proper
books. Now, you will have a pastor,
of course, and a church home. Make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
a friend of that pastor. He ought to
be a good adviser in the matter of
proper books. At any rate, get some
judicious friend to help you in the
choice. Buy only a very few books at
a time, and let your little home-library
grow gradually. Never buy a book
that you have your doubts about. Emerson's
advice to buy only a standard
work, which has been out for years,
has its good and safe quality. Avoid
too much fiction and a superabundance
of periodical literature. One popular
magazine is enough. The money which
you have for reading-matter should be
confined chiefly to books, and they
ought to be the world's masterpieces.</p>

<p>I am satisfied that in the average
home there is too little reading. History,
biography, travel, with a fair share
of religious books, can be read in course
at home, in the odd half hours, and the
mind become richly stored with facts.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Is there any thing in the domestic life
which ought to interfere with this constant
culture of the mind? Not at all.
The domestic life is highly favorable to
mental discipline. The very beginning
of real intellectual improvement in
many a mind has been in the new home
of persons just married. The reading
aloud of an interesting work, the one
to the other, is a delightful entertainment,
and gives a new charm to life.
Every effort must be employed to keep
the mind from becoming sluggish and
barren. We need information, the
thoughts of the good and great and
richly endowed, to make our own lives
richer.</p>

<p>It would be a wise arrangement if
every man and woman, on establishing
their home, would set apart some time
for intellectual improvement by the
reading of good books. I am acquainted
with a young lady, who, on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
entering her plain little house, found
that her husband and herself were so
interrupted by visits and other claims
on their time in the evening, that they
resolved to rise an hour earlier in the
morning, and devote the time to reading
and study. They were thus free
from interruption, and had ample opportunity,
before the regular duties of
the day began, to store their minds
with useful knowledge. I think it probable
that they will carry this excellent
custom with them through life.</p>

<p>Much of my time is spent in high-ways,
and along the narrow by-ways of
life. My homes are many. But when
my good fortune brings me at night to
occupy a room far from my own home,
where a good book or two are to be
found, I can say with Milton, in his
<i>Areopagitica</i>: "A good book is the precious
life-blood of a master-spirit embalmed
and treasured up on purpose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
to a life beyond;" and with Wordsworth,
in his "Personal Talk":</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Dreams, books, are each a world; and books, we know,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Are a substantial world, both pure and good;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Round these, with tendrils strong as flesh and blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our pastime and our happiness will grow."<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="lastpara">I like a home where you can see the
books. A choice book-case with glass
doors, and the doors locked, ought to
be expelled from the home. Let the
books be where they can be seen and
easily reached. Let them not be confined
to one room, but so distributed
that nearly every room shall have at
least a few in sight. A few books here
and there about the house, and even in
the bed-rooms, are worth more than a
costly piece of furniture. When we
see books in our homes, and they are
where we can handle them without effort,
we are apt to take them up, and
get snatches of good reading.</p>



<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page_37" id="page_37">[37]</a></span></p>
<h2>FORBEARANCE.</h2>


<p><span class = "firstletter">
<img src = "images/img_letter_t.png" width = "45" height = "45"
alt = "T"></img></span>he marriage bond is sacred. It
lasts for life: "Until death do
us part." But it is probable
that qualities of temperament and mind
in each one will develop which will surprise
the other. Some of these may produce
an unfavorable impression. Others
may prove most agreeable surprises.
Each person has come from a different
class of associations, and each has a different
nature. Here comes in the great
necessity of accommodation and adaptation.
Too early and too much criticism
spoils many a home. "One silent,
both happy," is an old motto well worth
observing. But often a single appreciative
word will brighten the whole sky.
One of Franklin's plain phrases has its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
wise lesson: "As we must account for
every idle word, so we must for every
idle silence." Frederika Bremer says:
"Marriage has a morrow, and again a
morrow." You will need to bear with
each other, and to so act, each to the
other, that every day may be made
beautiful and happy, and the whole
future one of mutual and respectful
forbearance.</p>

<p>"Foolish to think," says Dr. A. P.
Peabody, "that the whole mutual life
can flow on like the early stream, without
a ripple or eddy. Home is a school,
a discipline whereby husband and wife
are to grow unto each other, getting
rid of their angularities, harmonizing
their peculiar characteristics, and more
and more becoming one in thought,
sympathy, and life. The true blessedness
of wedded souls is not insured by
a simple exchange of plighted faith.
It comes through and after many a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
self-denial, many a crucifixion of the
will, many a scourging of the resentment,
anger, pride, vanity, and passions
of the heart. It is true here, as in
other relations, that 'he who saveth his
life shall lose it, and he that loseth his
life shall save it.'"</p>

<p>Do not forget, then, that the life at
home has its severe tests. If it is not
an expected thing, it will be the unexpected
which will try your nature and
make your burden heavy. You should
remember, if there is fault, that it is not
all on one side. The unkind word
may come to the lips, but it should
never be spoken.</p>

<p>The graces of patience, sublime calmness,
golden silence, should be cultivated
with delightful zeal. You may
each have had your way, but now the
way of another must be respected. Besides,
it may be a much better and safer
way than yours. John Angell James
says: "Where both have infirmities,
and they are so constantly together,
innumerable occasions will be furnished,
if we are eager, or even willing,
to avail ourselves of the opportunities
for those contentions which, if they do
not produce a permanent suppression
of love, lead to its temporary interruption.
Many things we should connive
at, others we should pass by with
an unprovoked mind, and in all things
most carefully avoid even what at
first may seem to be an innocent disputation."</p>

<p>The real basis of adaptation is mutual
respect and love. Neither the hus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>band
nor the wife must judge each
other too critically. The indiscreet
word, or error of any kind, must never
be allowed to cause a doubt as to the
heart's deep affection. Gentleness, patience,
time, will give ample opportunity
for the full sunlight to break forth.
Each heart needs the other for true
happiness. It must be a united life.
In "Hiawatha" we read the true relation:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"As unto the bow the cord is,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So unto the man is woman,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though she bends him, she obeys him;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though she draws him, yet she follows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Useless each without the other."<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The married life, to be supremely
happy, must be thoroughly unselfish. I
was once on shipboard with a tourist
who was accompanied by his wife, but
for whose opinion he seemed, even to
other travelers, to show but little respect.
The voyage was a long one,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
and while the wife's bearing was most
gentle and kindly, his manner impressed
me as thoroughly selfish. I
do not imagine that he was aware of
the abrupt and strongly personal quality
of his bearing toward his refined
and cultured wife. With all his wealth
he lacked that appearance of tenderness
which is more than gold or precious
stones.</p>

<p>No effort must be spared by either
husband or wife to contribute to the
other's happiness and comfort. It does
not require a long time, especially when
living together, for one to see what will
please another. This desire to please,
strengthening with the days and years,
revealing itself in a thousand kindly
ways, will do more than any thing else
to make the home a paradise on earth.</p>

<p>Cowper gives the true secret of a
beautiful and strengthening reciprocal
adaptation:</p>

<p class="lastpara">I believe the Germans excel all
others in literature in their warm tributes
to the faithful love and devotion
of their wives. Kerner, the Suabian
author, said this beautiful word in testimony
of his wife after their long years
of happiness together: "She hath borne
with me." Martin Luther said of his
wife, the devoted Catherine: "I would
not exchange my poverty with her for
all the riches of Cr&oelig;sus without her."
Bismarck, the man of "blood and iron,"
says of his wife: "She it is who made
me what I am."</p>

Our conduct at home
should be such that the morrow
will bring no regrets. Mrs. Sigourney
thus describes the changes that must
come over the brightest home:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">

</div>
</div>

<p>It is sad enough when either a man
or his wife learns first, when one or
the other is taken away by death, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
there has been a life-long want of considerate
tenderness.</p>

<p>Supposing the late Thomas Carlyle
had been a little more attentive to his
brilliant and devoted wife during their
long and lonely life in the plain home
in Cheyne Row, in Chelsea, London,
such words as these, which escaped
her in a letter to a friend, could never
have been said: "Those little attentions
which we women attach so much
importance to he was never in the
habit of rendering to any one; his upbringing,
and the severe turn of mind
he has from nature, had alike indisposed
him toward them."</p>

<p>But the grim old man saw his mistake
at last. It was all too late, however.
It was only after all her sacrifices
had been made, and he had
written his many works, and she lay in
her grave, that he awoke to a knowledge
of his long neglect. Mr. Froude<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
says that Carlyle often said, when there
was no more opportunity for a kind
word to reach his wife: "O if I could
but see her for five minutes, to assure
her that I really cared for her throughout
all that; but she never knew it,
she never knew it." It is no wonder
that Mr. Froude was compelled to
write of Carlyle these sad words: "For
many years after she had left him,
when he passed the spot where she was
last seen alive he would bare his gray
head in the wind and rain, his features
wrung with unavailing sorrow."</p>

<p>We are prone to take too many
things for granted. You should not assume
that your thoughtless word, or
harsh manner, or forgetfulness of little
and delicate attentions will have no
effect, and will be duly passed by as
unmeaning. No such thing! Every
word or look which is incompatible
with genuine love and respect weighs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
like a millstone. Gentle attentions
will be remembered, not only through
the day, but through all the days. Recently,
while on a visit in Irvington-on-the-Hudson,
the widow of a celebrated
publisher led me to the portrait of her
lamented husband, and stood in admiration
before the magnificent painting.
She then said to me: "I esteem it the
greatest honor that could be conferred
upon me to have been the wife of such
a man." Could there be a grander tribute
to an attentive and devoted husband?</p>

<p>In that exquisite work, <i>Memorials
of a Quiet Life</i>, Mrs. Hare pays this
beautiful tribute to her husband: "I
never saw any body so easy to live
with, by whom the daily petty things
of life were passed over so lightly; and
then there is a charm in the <i>refinement</i>
of feeling which is not to be told in its
influence upon trifles." Mrs. Stowe, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
describing the good qualities of the
Duchess of Sutherland in her own
home in Scotland, says that she excelled
in <i>considerateness</i>. Paul's advice
is as beautiful as it is true, and suits
young married people perfectly. In
the Revised Version it reads thus:
"In lowliness of mind each counting
other better than himself; not looking
each of you to his own things, but each
of you also to the things of others."
Another piece of Pauline advice is of
equally useful quality: "Let us therefore
follow after the things which make
for peace, and things wherewith one
may edify another."</p>

<p class="lastpara">Happy are they whom death has not
yet divided, and to whom it is still
granted to say such words and do such
kindly acts as will prove delightful
memories when the Happy To-Days
become only Yesterdays in the Home.</p>

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/license">http://www.gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
